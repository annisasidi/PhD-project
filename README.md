Markdown Syntax

##Text Decorations

We're talking about **bolds**, *italics* and ~strikethroughs~.

This is another way to make __bold__ and _italicised_ words.

Now I can combine **_bolds and italics_** together.

## Bullet points, numbered lists and checked lists

### Bullet points

This is how you make bullet point lists:
* bullet point 1
* bullet point 2
* bullet point 3

This is another way to make bullet points
- bullet point 1
- bullet point 2
- bullet point 3

### Numbered list

Numbered list:
1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

### Checked list

TO DO's and DONE's:

- [ ] item 1
- [ ] item 2
- [x] item 3

### Nesting lists
* item one
  * sub-item one
* item two
  * sub-item two
* item three

## Tables

Let's make a clean table with Markdown:

| Name | Age | Department | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
|Riku|25|Biochem|ARF|
|Ruth|34|Biochem|ARF|
|Mik|old|Biochem|stats guy|

| Name | Age | Department | Job |
|:---|---:|---|:---:|
|Riku|25|Biochem|ARF|
|Ruth|34|Biochem|ARF|
|Mik|old|Biochem|stats guy|

## Markdown paragraphs, texts and quotes

So this sentence contains only a single whitespace in between the words.

But   this   sentence   contains   a   lot   of   whitespace   in   between     the   words.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

This is how you print quotes:

> "You're a wizard, Harry."

## Links/hyperlinks

The syntax is relatively simple:

This is a link to [Google](https://www.google.com)

## Codes and syntax highlighting

You can insert codes inline with a pair of `backticks`.

```
echo hello world
cd /
rm -rf *
```

**DON'T RUN THIS CODE**

```bash
echo hello world
cd /
rm -rf *
```
